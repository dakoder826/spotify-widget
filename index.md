# Privacy Policy

Last updated: November 10, 2025

## Overview

This app (“Spotify Add Widget”) lets you quickly add the currently playing Spotify track to a selected playlist from your iPhone Lock Screen or Home Screen. We respect your privacy and keep things simple: we do not collect, sell, or share your personal data.

We are not affiliated with Spotify AB.

## Data We Collect

We do not collect, store, or transmit personal data to our servers. The app has no analytics SDKs, ad SDKs, or crash reporting that sends data to us.

## Authentication and Tokens

The app uses Spotify OAuth with PKCE to securely authorize your Spotify account.

- Access tokens and refresh tokens are stored locally on your device in an App Group container so the widget can function.
- Tokens are never sent to any server we control.
- You can revoke access at any time by logging out in the app or removing the app’s access in your Spotify account settings. Removing the app or logging out clears locally stored tokens.

## Permissions (Spotify Scopes)

To provide its features, the app requests these Spotify scopes:

- `user-read-currently-playing` — read the currently playing track
- `playlist-modify-public` — add tracks to your public playlists
- `playlist-modify-private` — add tracks to your private playlists
- `playlist-read-private` — list your private playlists
- `playlist-read-collaborative` — list collaborative playlists

These permissions are used only to:

1. detect your currently playing track, and
2. display/select your playlists and add the track to the chosen playlist.

## Third‑Party Services

All music data comes directly from the Spotify Web API. We do not proxy or store Spotify responses.

## Data Retention & Deletion

- Tokens are stored only on your device and removed when you log out or uninstall the app.
- You can revoke access from your Spotify account dashboard at any time.


## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. Material changes will be reflected on this page with an updated “Last updated” date.
